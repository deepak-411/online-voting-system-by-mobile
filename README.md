# online-voting-system-by-mobile
In todayâ€™s world of growing advanced mobile technologies, the traditional voting method can be changed to a newer and  effective approach termed as mobile voting. The Mobile voting system provides a convenient, easy and efficient way to vote eliminating the shortcomings of traditional approach. In this paper we propose to build an E-Voting system which is basically an online voting system through which people can cast their vote through their smart phones or by using an e-voting website. To achieve the required security we are using OTP (one time password) approach, which is most commonly on the web to tell the difference between a human using a web service and an automated bot thus making the website more secure against spam- bot attacks. If the results of the matching algorithm are three point match then checks whether this person own voter ID after that it will check with AADHAAR ID, If he has the right to vote then a voting form is presented to him, and the third level of authentication is carried out by using One Time Password (OTP) principle. Nowadays Technology is being used more and more as a tool to contribution voters to cast their votes. To allow the use of this right, almost all voting systems around the world contain the following steps: Voter identification and authentication, voting and recording of votes cast, vote counting, publication of election results.
